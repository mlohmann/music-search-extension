# Streaming Music Search

This Chrome extension needs to be installed in Developer Mode since it's not published on the Chrome Web Store. Follow these simple steps to get started:

## Installation Steps

1. Download or clone this repository to your local machine
2. Open Google Chrome
3. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
4. Enable "Developer mode" by toggling the switch in the top right corner
5. Click "Load unpacked" button that appears after enabling Developer mode
6. Select the directory containing the extension files

## Usage
1. Once installed, highlight any text, right click, then select your prefered search method
2. You can open the extension options to select only your favorite streaming services

## Important Notes

- The extension needs to remain in the same location on your computer after installation
- If you move the folder, you'll need to update the location in Chrome
- Disabling Developer Mode will disable the extension
- Updates need to be manually installed by clicking the refresh icon on the extension card

## Troubleshooting

If the extension disappears after a Chrome restart:
1. Check if Developer Mode is still enabled
2. If disabled, re-enable it and the extension should reappear
3. If not, follow the installation steps again

## Security Note

Only install extensions in Developer Mode from sources you trust. This mode bypasses some of Chrome's standard security checks for extensions.
